[← Back to Index](00-index.md) | [Next: Network Architecture →](02-network-architecture.md)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive 11-week implementation timeline for the enterprise PKI modernization project, deploying a hybrid Azure-based public key infrastructure with on-premises integration across Australian regions. The project will establish a robust, scalable, and compliant certificate services architecture supporting 10,000+ endpoints.

## Project Overview

### Strategic Objectives
- **Modernize** legacy PKI infrastructure with cloud-native capabilities
- **Enhance** security posture with HSM-protected root CA in Azure
- **Automate** certificate lifecycle management reducing manual overhead by 80%
- **Integrate** seamlessly with existing enterprise services (AD, Intune, SCCM)
- **Ensure** compliance with Australian regulatory requirements (ACSC ISM, Privacy Act)

### Project Scope
- **Geographic Coverage**: Australia East (Primary), Australia Southeast (DR)
- **User Base**: 10,000+ devices, 5,000+ users
- **Certificate Types**: SSL/TLS, Code Signing, S/MIME, Device Authentication, 802.1X
- **Integration Points**: 15+ enterprise systems
- **Migration Approach**: Phased with zero-downtime cutover
