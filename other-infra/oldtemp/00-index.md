## Implementation Overview

This implementation plan covers the complete modernization of the PKI infrastructure, including:

1. **Cloud-First Architecture**: Azure Private CA as the root with on-premises issuing CAs
2. **Zero-Touch Enrollment**: Automated certificate lifecycle management
3. **Multi-Platform Support**: Windows, mobile devices, servers, and IoT
4. **High Availability**: Geo-redundant design with 99.99% availability target
5. **Security Integration**: HSM protection, automated monitoring, and compliance

## Regional Configuration

All configurations have been updated for **Australian** deployments:
- Primary Region: **Australia East** (Sydney)
- Secondary Region: **Australia Southeast** (Melbourne)
- DR Region: **Australia Central** (Canberra)

## Quick Start Guide

1. Review the [Project Timeline](01-project-timeline.md) to understand the implementation phases
2. Examine the [Network Architecture](02-network-architecture.md) for infrastructure requirements
3. Follow the phase-specific guides (Phases 1-5) for detailed implementation steps
4. Use the scripts in the [Scripts](Scripts/) folder for automation
5. Refer to [Post-Implementation Operations](11-post-implementation.md) for ongoing management

## Support and Contact

For questions or issues regarding this PKI implementation plan, please contact the PKI team or refer to the detailed documentation in each section.
