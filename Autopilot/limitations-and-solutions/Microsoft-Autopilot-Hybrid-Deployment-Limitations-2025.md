   # Verify Azure AD Connect sync status
   Get-ADSyncScheduler
   
   # Force synchronization if needed
   Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
   
   # Verify user account synchronization
   Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "user@domain.com"
   ```

2. **Pre-deployment user account validation:**
   ```powershell
   # Script to validate user accounts before deployment
   $users = Import-Csv "C:\DeploymentUsers.csv"
   foreach ($user in $users) {
       $adUser = Get-ADUser -Filter "UserPrincipalName -eq '$($user.UPN)'" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
       $azureUser = Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $user.UPN -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
       
       if ($adUser -and $azureUser) {
           Write-Output "✅ $($user.UPN) - Ready for hybrid join"
       } else {
           Write-Output "❌ $($user.UPN) - Missing AD or Azure AD account"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **User communication and training:**
   - Provide clear instructions on using domain credentials
   - Train users on domain\username format requirements
   - Create self-service password reset processes
   - Document authentication troubleshooting steps

#### LIM-005: Conditional Access Policy Conflicts
**Category**: Security/Compliance  
**Impact**: High  
**User Experience**: Blocking

**Limitation Description:**
Conditional Access policies can interfere with hybrid Autopilot deployment, particularly during initial device registration and compliance evaluation phases.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Device-based policies may block unregistered devices
- Compliance state shows "N/A" until user sign-in
- Dual device identity creation can cause policy confusion
- Risk-based policies may trigger during deployment

**Policy Conflict Scenarios:**
```
Problematic Policy Types:
- Device compliance requirement during enrollment
- Location-based restrictions for new devices
- Risk-based policies triggering on new device registration
- Multi-factor authentication requirements during OOBE
```

**Workarounds:**
1. **Conditional Access exclusions for Autopilot:**
   ```json
   {
     "conditions": {
       "users": {
         "excludeUsers": ["AutopilotServiceAccount"],
         "excludeGroups": ["Autopilot-Deployment-Exclusion"]
       },

   - Document policy exceptions and approval processes

### Device Management and Compliance Gotchas

#### LIM-006: Duplicate Device Object Creation
**Category**: Device Management  
**Impact**: Medium-High  
**Operational**: Ongoing

**Limitation Description:**
Hybrid Autopilot creates duplicate device objects in Azure AD by design - one for Autopilot registration and another for hybrid join, causing management confusion.

**Technical Impact:**
- Two device identities for same physical device
- Compliance reporting confusion
- Policy assignment complexity
- Cleanup and maintenance overhead

**Device Object Structure:**
```
Device Object 1: Autopilot Registration
- ObjectId: [Autopilot-Generated-GUID]
- DeviceId: [Hardware-Hash-Derived]
- TrustType: "Autopilot"
- JoinType: "Registered"

Device Object 2: Hybrid Join
- ObjectId: [Domain-Join-Generated-GUID] 
- DeviceId: [Different-GUID]
- TrustType: "ServerAD"
- JoinType: "Hybrid Azure AD joined"
```

**Workarounds:**
1. **Device object monitoring and cleanup:**
   ```powershell
   # Script to identify duplicate device objects
   $devices = Get-MgDevice -All
   $duplicates = $devices | Group-Object DisplayName | Where-Object {$_.Count -gt 1}
   
   foreach ($duplicate in $duplicates) {
       Write-Output "Device: $($duplicate.Name)"
       foreach ($device in $duplicate.Group) {
           Write-Output "  ID: $($device.Id), Trust: $($device.TrustType), Join: $($device.ProfileType)"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Automated cleanup processes:**
   ```powershell
   # Clean up stale Autopilot device objects
   $autopilotDevices = Get-MgDevice -Filter "trustType eq 'Autopilot'"
   $hybridDevices = Get-MgDevice -Filter "trustType eq 'ServerAD'"
   
   foreach ($autopilotDevice in $autopilotDevices) {
       $matching = $hybridDevices | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq $autopilotDevice.DisplayName}
       if ($matching -and $autopilotDevice.ApproximateLastSignInDateTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)) {
           Remove-MgDevice -DeviceId $autopilotDevice.Id
           Write-Output "Removed stale Autopilot device: $($autopilotDevice.DisplayName)"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Reporting and monitoring:**
   - Create dashboards showing device object counts
   - Monitor for excessive duplicate creation
   - Alert on cleanup threshold violations
   - Regular auditing of device object health

#### LIM-007: Compliance State Synchronization Delays
**Category**: Compliance/Reporting  
**Impact**: Medium  
**User Experience**: Confusing

**Limitation Description:**
Hybrid devices show compliance state as "N/A" until initial user sign-in, potentially blocking access through Conditional Access policies that require device compliance.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Compliance evaluation requires user context
- Initial sync delays up to 8 hours
- Policy evaluation dependency on compliance state
- Reporting accuracy impacts during transition period

**Compliance State Lifecycle:**
```
Timeline: Hybrid Device Compliance Evaluation
0-2 hours:   Device joins domain, registers in Azure AD
2-4 hours:   Device policies begin evaluation
4-8 hours:   Compliance policies apply, but state = "N/A"
8+ hours:    First user sign-in triggers compliance sync
8-24 hours:  Compliance state becomes accurate
```

**Workarounds:**
1. **Compliance policy adjustments:**
   ```json
   {
     "scheduledActionsForRule": [
       {
         "ruleName": "PasswordRequired",
         "scheduledActionConfigurations": [
           {
             "actionType": "block",
             "gracePeriodHours": 24,
             "notificationTemplateId": "DelayedComplianceTemplate"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Conditional Access grace periods:**
   ```powershell
   # Create grace period policy for new hybrid devices
   $gracePeriodPolicy = @{
       displayName = "Hybrid Device Grace Period"
       conditions = @{
           devices = @{
               deviceFilter = @{
                   mode = "include"
                   rule = "(device.trustType -eq 'ServerAD') and (device.registrationDateTime -gt '$(((Get-Date).AddDays(-1)).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd'))')"
               }
           }
       }
       grantControls = @{
           operator = "AND"
           builtInControls = @("compliantDevice")
           customAuthenticationFactors = @()
       }
   }
   ```

3. **User communication strategy:**
   - Notify users of potential temporary access restrictions
   - Provide alternative authentication methods during grace period
   - Document expected timeline for compliance state resolution
   - Create help desk procedures for compliance state issues

   {
     "win32LobApp": {
       "installCommandLine": "setup.exe /quiet /norestart",
       "uninstallCommandLine": "setup.exe /uninstall /quiet",
       "installContext": "system",
       "dependentAppCount": 1,
       "childRelationships": [
         {
           "targetId": "prerequisite-app-id",
           "targetDisplayName": "Required Component",
           "dependencyType": "detect"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Group Policy and Intune policy coordination:**
   ```powershell
   # Script to identify policy conflicts
   $intunePolices = Get-MgDeviceManagementDeviceConfiguration

## Migration Planning Framework

### Assessment Questionnaire for Cloud-Native Migration

#### Organizational Readiness Assessment
```
1. Application Dependencies
   □ Catalog all applications requiring domain authentication
   □ Identify applications with hard-coded domain dependencies  
   □ Assess modernization feasibility for each application
   □ Calculate migration cost vs. benefit for each app

2. Infrastructure Dependencies
   □ Document file share dependencies requiring domain access
   □ Identify network resources requiring domain authentication
   □ Assess printer and device dependencies
   □ Evaluate backup and monitoring system integration

3. Compliance and Security Requirements
   □ Review regulatory requirements for on-premises AD
   □ Assess data residency and sovereignty constraints
   □ Evaluate audit and compliance reporting dependencies
   □ Review security policy compatibility with cloud-native approach

4. User Experience Impact
   □ Assess user training requirements for cloud authentication
   □ Evaluate single sign-on experience changes
   □ Review password management and reset procedures
   □ Assess remote access and VPN dependency changes
```

#### Migration Planning Timeline
```
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Assessment and Planning
- Complete dependency analysis
- Design target state architecture  
- Create migration strategy and timeline
- Establish pilot program criteria

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Pilot Implementation
- Deploy cloud-native pilot for small subset of devices
- Test application compatibility and user experience
- Validate security and compliance controls
- Refine deployment procedures and documentation

Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Gradual Migration
- Migrate devices in waves based on dependency assessment
- Modernize or replace legacy applications
- Decommission on-premises infrastructure components
- Monitor and optimize cloud-native operations

Phase 4 (Months 13-18): Completion and Optimization
- Complete migration for all suitable devices
- Optimize cloud-native configurations
- Implement advanced security and compliance features
- Document lessons learned and best practices
```
