## Risk Management - Australian Context

### Regulatory Risks
- **APRA CPS 234 Compliance**: Operational resilience requirements
- **Privacy Act 1988**: Personal information protection in certificates
- **Essential Eight**: Cyber security framework alignment

### Operational Risks
- **Timezone Challenges**: Coordination between AEST/AEDT and global teams
- **Data Residency**: Ensuring certificate data remains within Australian borders
- **Business Continuity**: Maintaining 99.99% uptime for critical financial services

## Success Criteria

1. **100% Australian Data Residency** - All certificate data stored within Australia
2. **APRA CPS 234 Compliance** - Full operational resilience framework implementation
3. **Essential Eight Alignment** - All eight mitigation strategies implemented
4. **99.99% Uptime** - Service availability during Australian business hours
5. **Zero Data Breaches** - No incidents requiring notification under Privacy Act 1988

## Resource Requirements - Australian Team

### Core Team (Based in Sydney/Melbourne)
- **Project Manager** (PMP certified, Australian security clearance)
- **PKI Architect** (CISSP, Australian Government experience)
- **Network Security Engineer** (CCNP Security, local data centre experience)
- **Compliance Specialist** (APRA/ASIC experience)
- **DevOps Engineer** (Azure certified, Australian regions expertise)

### Extended Team Support
