# Password Expiration Policies: Why They're Counterproductive

## Comprehensive Research and Industry Guidance

### Validated October 1, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Modern security research continues to demonstrate that mandatory password expiration policies harm security more than help it. Both Microsoft and NIST have maintained their positions against password expiration, with NIST publishing the final version of SP 800-63B-4 in July 2025. These evidence-based guidelines confirm that forced password changes lead to weaker, more predictable passwords.

**Critical Date:** Organizations must migrate from legacy MFA and SSPR policies to the new unified Authentication Methods policy before September 30, 2025, to avoid service disruptions.

## Microsoft's Official Position

### Primary Documentation

Microsoft has published multiple official documents explaining their stance against password expiration:

- **[Password Policy Recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations)** - Core guidance document
- **[Set Password Expiration Policy for Your Organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/set-password-expiration-policy)** - Implementation guide
- **[Maximum Password Age - Windows 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/maximum-password-age)** - Technical documentation

### Key Microsoft Statements

**From Password Policy Recommendations:**

> "Current research strongly indicates that mandated password changes do more harm than good. They drive users to choose weaker passwords, reuse passwords, or update old passwords in ways that are easily guessed by hackers."

**From 2019 Security Baseline Update:**

> "Periodic password expiration is an ancient and obsolete mitigation of very low value"

### Microsoft's Research Findings

**Human Behavior Impact:**

> "Understanding human nature is critical because research shows that almost every rule you impose on your users results in a weakening of password quality. Length requirements, special character requirements, and password change requirements all result in normalization of passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to guess or crack passwords."

## NIST Guidelines Evolution

### Current NIST Position (2025 Final Release)

The National Institute of Standards and Technology published the final version of SP 800-63B-4 in July 2025, maintaining and strengthening their position against mandatory password expiration:

- **[NIST SP 800-63B-4 Final Version (July 2025)](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html)** - Official NIST publication
- **[NIST SP 800-63B-4 Second Public Draft](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63B-4.2pd.pdf)** - Previous draft for reference

### Key NIST Recommendations (2025 Final)

**From SP 800-63B-4 (July 2025):**

- Verifiers SHALL NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically)
- Verifiers SHALL NOT impose composition rules (mixtures of character types)
- Minimum password length increased to 8 characters, with 12-16 characters strongly recommended
- Maximum password length remains at 64 characters
- Compare passwords against known compromised password lists
- Strong emphasis on passwordless authentication methods
- Support for password managers is mandatory

**2025 Updates Focus:**

- Enhanced support for passphrases over complex passwords
- Expanded character set support including Unicode
- Continuous prohibition of password hints
- Strengthened recommendations for risk-based authentication
- Introduction of adaptive authentication policies

## Why Password Expiration is Counterproductive

### 1. Predictable Pattern Creation

**Evidence Sources:**

- **[Microsoft Learn - Password Policy Recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations)**
- **[Varonis Blog - Microsoft's Expiring Passwords](https://www.varonis.com/blog/microsofts-expiring-passwords)** - Industry analysis

**Common Patterns Users Develop:**

- Sequential numbering: Password1, Password2, Password3
- Seasonal patterns: Spring2024, Summer2024, Fall2024
- Minor character substitutions: P@ssword1, P@ssword2

### 2. Decreased Password Strength

**Supporting Documentation:**

- **[ISC2 Community Discussion](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Industry-News/Microsoft-and-NIST-Say-Password-Expiration-Policies-Are-No/td-p/39893)** - Security professional perspectives
- **[Information Security Stack Exchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32222/are-password-complexity-rules-counterproductive)** - Technical community discussion

**Key Finding:**
Users compensate for frequent changes by:

- Creating weaker initial passwords
- Writing passwords down
- Reusing passwords across systems with slight variations

### 3. False Security Theater

**Analysis Sources:**

- **[TechCrunch Coverage](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/windows-password-expiry/)** - Industry reporting
- **[Engadget Analysis](https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-24-microsoft-password-expiration-security.html)** - Technology journalism

**Core Logic Flaw:**

> "If a password is never stolen, there's no need to expire it. And if you have evidence that a password has been stolen, you would presumably act immediately rather than wait for expiration to fix the problem."

## Modern Security Recommendations

### Microsoft's Current Best Practices

**From Official Documentation:**

- **[Password Policy Recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations)**
- **[Microsoft Entra Password Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad-combined-policy)**

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Minimum 14-character length requirement**
2. **No character composition requirements**
3. **No mandatory periodic password resets**
4. **Ban common/compromised passwords**
5. **Enforce multi-factor authentication**
6. **Enable risk-based authentication challenges**

### Default Policies for New Organizations

**Important Clarification for Modern Tenants:**

- Tenants created **after 2021** have passwords set to **never expire by default**
- The password validity period is configured as **unlimited** unless specifically overridden
- This can be modified on a per-user basis using PowerShell: `Update-MgUser -UserId <user ID> -PasswordPolicies DisablePasswordExpiration`
- Organizations can still configure expiration if required for compliance, but Microsoft recommends against it

## 2025 Status Update

### Current Validation (as of October 1, 2025)

**Microsoft's Position - Unchanged:**
As recently confirmed in July 2025 documentation updates, Microsoft maintains that "Current research strongly indicates that mandated password changes do more harm than good. They drive users to choose weaker passwords, reuse passwords, or update old passwords in ways that are easily guessed by hackers."

**NIST SP 800-63B-4 Final Release (July 2025):**
NIST published the final version of SP 800-63B-4 in July 2025, maintaining their stance against mandatory password expiration while emphasizing password length (12-16 character recommendation) over complexity and strongly encouraging passwordless authentication methods.

### Important Upcoming Changes

**September 30, 2025 - MFA/SSPR Policy Migration:**
Microsoft will deprecate legacy multifactor authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR) policies on September 30, 2025. Organizations must migrate to the new unified Authentication Methods policy before this date to avoid potential service disruptions.

**Migration Resources:**

- **[How to Migrate MFA and SSPR Policy Settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-migrate-mfa-sspr-to-authentication-methods-policy)** - Migration guide

### Default Policies for Modern Tenants

**Clarification for New Organizations:**
For tenants created after 2021, passwords are set to never expire by default. The password validity period is set to unlimited unless specifically overridden on a per-user basis or at the domain level.

---

## Conclusion

The evidence remains clear in 2025: mandatory password expiration policies are counterproductive to security goals. Both Microsoft and NIST have maintained and strengthened their positions against forced password changes. With the final release of NIST SP 800-63B-4 in July 2025 and Microsoft's continued reinforcement of this guidance, organizations should confidently move away from password expiration while implementing modern security controls.

**Final Recommendation:** Remove password expiration requirements while implementing strong compensating controls including MFA, banned password lists, risk-based authentication, and consider transitioning to passwordless authentication methods.
