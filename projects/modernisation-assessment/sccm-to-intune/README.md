# SCCM-to-Intune Transition Assessment — Master Index

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Assessment Date**: 2026-02-18
**Assessment Scope**: 10 capability areas, 14 documents, 200+ feature comparisons

---

## Introduction

This assessment provides a comprehensive, capability-by-capability analysis of Microsoft Intune as a replacement for on-premises System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). The document set uses a **SCCM-centric approach**: for every SCCM capability, we identify the Intune equivalent, rate parity level, document licensing requirements, and provide migration guidance.

**How to Use This Document Set**:

- **Executives**: Read [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md) for consolidated RAG ratings, top gaps/advantages, licensing summary, and recommendations
- **IT Leadership**: Read Executive Summary, then priority assessments ([OS Deployment](os-deployment.md), [Patch Management](patch-management.md), [Endpoint Protection](endpoint-protection.md))
- **Technical Teams**: Read all 10 capability area assessments for detailed feature mapping and migration guidance
- **Project Managers**: Use [Organization Template](org-template.md) to capture environment-specific configuration for scoping

**Key Findings**:

- **Overall Parity**: 7 of 10 capability areas achieve Near Parity or better; 3 areas have Significant Gaps requiring remediation
- **Biggest Gap**: OS Deployment (task sequences, bare-metal imaging) — requires OEM custom imaging, SCCM hybrid model, or workflow redesign
- **Biggest Win**: Endpoint Protection with native MDE integration and Conditional Access — immediate zero-trust enablement
- **Paradigm Shift**: Infrastructure (site hierarchy → flat cloud tenant) — not a gap to remediate, but an architectural transformation requiring new operational models

## Parity Rating Legend

All capability mappings use a **five-level parity scale** plus one supplementary tag:

| Rating               | Symbol | Definition                                                                                                         | Colour Indicator | Implication                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Parity**      | 🟢     | Intune feature is functionally equivalent to SCCM. No capability loss.                                             | Green            | Migrate with confidence. No workarounds required.                                                                                        |
| **Near Parity**      | 🟡     | ≥80% capability coverage. Minor functional differences or administrative overhead differences.                     | Yellow-Green     | Migrate; document minor differences for operational awareness. Workarounds available for remaining 20%.                                  |
| **Partial**          | 🟠     | 40-79% capability coverage. Workarounds exist but introduce administrative overhead or require additional tooling. | Orange           | Migrate with workarounds. Document workarounds and accept trade-offs (increased admin effort, third-party tools).                        |
| **Significant Gap**  | 🔴     | <40% capability coverage. Core functionality missing. Third-party tools or retained SCCM workload required.        | Red              | Flag for remediation planning. Evaluate third-party solutions, co-management retention, or accept capability loss.                       |
| **No Equivalent**    | ⬛     | SCCM capability has zero Intune counterpart. Architectural or design difference prevents coverage.                 | Black            | Retain SCCM workload via co-management, adopt third-party solution, or accept capability loss. Not a "gap" but a fundamental difference. |
| **Intune Advantage** | 🔵     | Intune exceeds SCCM capability. Cloud-native features with no SCCM equivalent.                                     | Blue             | No investigation required — note as migration benefit. Leverage these advantages for business value justification.                       |

### Rating Application Guidelines

**Area-Level Rating** (Overall Parity Rating for each capability area):

- Derived from weighted assessment of individual feature ratings
- Critical features weighted more heavily than administrative conveniences
- Example: OS Deployment rated "Significant Gap" because bare-metal imaging (critical) has No Equivalent, despite in-place upgrade (Full Parity)

**Feature-Level Rating** (Individual SCCM features in Feature Parity Matrix):

- Each SCCM feature rated independently
- Rationale documented for each rating with specific Intune feature names and limitations
- Where feature spans multiple ratings (e.g., "Partial for advanced use, Full Parity for basic use"), range stated with conditions explained

## Assessment Methodology

### SCCM-Centric Approach

This assessment answers the question: **"Does Intune cover this SCCM capability?"** — not "What can Intune do?"

**Methodology Principles**:

1. **Start from SCCM**: Every assessment begins with SCCM feature inventory
2. **Map to Intune**: Identify Intune equivalent (or absence thereof)
3. **Rate Parity**: Apply five-level scale with rationale
4. **Document Remediation**: For gaps, provide remediation options (third-party tools, co-management retention, acceptance)
5. **Note Advantages**: Where Intune exceeds SCCM, document advantage (no remediation needed)

### SCCM Version Baseline

**SCCM Version Assessed**: Configuration Manager Current Branch **2403+** (latest as of February 2026)

**Rationale**: Organizations planning migration should be on Current Branch latest version. Features deprecated in 2403+ (e.g., Resource Access slider) are noted as prerequisites for migration.

### Intune Version Baseline

**Intune Version Assessed**: Current production (February 2026)

**Continuous Updates**: Intune is a cloud service updated continuously. Assessment reflects capabilities as of February 2026. New features may be announced after this date (check [Microsoft Intune Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-intune-blog/bg-p/MicrosoftEndpointManagerBlog) for updates).

### Source Verification

**Source Hierarchy** (in order of preference):

1. **Microsoft Learn** (learn.microsoft.com) — Official product documentation
2. **Microsoft Tech Community** (techcommunity.microsoft.com) — Official Microsoft blogs, announcements
3. **Community Technical Resources** — systemcenterdudes.com, patchmypc.com, anoopcnair.com, prajwaldesai.com, msendpointmgr.com (for practical guidance and real-world validation)

**Source Citation**: All feature comparisons cite sources with hyperlinks for verification.

### Diátaxis Classification

Assessment documents intentionally blend three [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation modes within each capability area document:

- **Reference**: Feature Parity Matrices, licensing tables, configuration examples — structured for lookup
- **How-to**: Migration strategies, checklists, pre-migration assessment scripts — task-oriented guidance
- **Explanation**: Paradigm shift narratives, architectural comparisons, impact analysis — understanding-oriented context

This blending is by design. Each capability assessment serves as a complete resource for decision-making about that capability area, and separating these modes into different documents would fragment the decision context. The Feature Parity Matrix (reference) is the primary deliverable; Key Findings (explanation) and Migration Considerations (how-to) provide the narrative context needed to act on the matrix.

### Table-Led Structure

**Primary Assessment Tool**: Feature Parity Matrix

Every capability area assessment includes a Feature Parity Matrix table:

| SCCM Feature | Intune Equivalent                     | Parity Rating     | Licensing    | Notes         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Feature name | Equivalent feature or "No equivalent" | Rating from scale | License tier | Brief context |

**Narrative Support**: Tables supplemented with narrative for nuanced areas (gaps, advantages, migration considerations) that tables cannot fully capture.

### Document Structure Template

Each capability area assessment follows this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** — 3-5 sentences: overall parity rating, top 2-3 gaps, top Intune advantages
2. **Feature Parity Matrix** — Primary comparison table (all SCCM features vs. Intune equivalents)
3. **Key Findings** — Narrative subsections:
   - Full/Near Parity Areas
   - Partial Parity / Gaps
   - Significant Gaps / No Equivalent
   - Intune Advantages
4. **Licensing Impact** — Features gated by licensing tier (Plan 1, Plan 2, Suite, E3, E5, MDE P1/P2)
5. **Migration Considerations** — Practical guidance for transitioning this capability area
6. **Sources** — Hyperlinked references to Microsoft Learn and community sources

## Migration Complexity Factors

### Organizational Factors

**High-Complexity Organizations** (longer migration timeline; 12-24 months):

- Large application portfolio (>200 applications)
- Extensive custom hardware inventory (>10 custom WMI classes)
- Active orchestration groups for server clusters
- Bare-metal imaging requirements
- Complex task sequences (>40 steps, conditional logic, hardware-specific drivers)
- Heavy reliance on software metering for license compliance
- Disconnected environments (no internet access)

**Medium-Complexity Organizations** (typical migration timeline; 6-12 months):

- Moderate application portfolio (50-200 applications)
- Standard hardware inventory (minimal custom WMI extensions)
- No orchestration groups (standalone servers or workstations only)
- Autopilot-compatible OS deployment scenarios (new device procurement, simple refresh)
- Standard task sequences (<20 steps)
- Limited software metering usage
- Full internet connectivity via CMG or VPN

**Low-Complexity Organizations** (fast migration timeline; 3-6 months):

- Small application portfolio (<50 applications)
- No custom hardware inventory
- Workstations only (no servers)
- New device procurement only (no imaging or refresh requirements)
- No task sequences
- No software metering
- Cloud-first organization (Entra Hybrid Join already deployed)

### Technical Factors

**Migration Accelerators** (reduce timeline):

- Co-management already enabled
- CMG deployed and functional
- Entra Hybrid Join >90% coverage
- M365 E5 licensing (includes MDE P2, Intune Suite features from July 2026)
- Active Directory clean and well-maintained
- SCCM on Current Branch 2403+

**Migration Blockers** (extend timeline or prevent full migration):

- No Entra Hybrid Join (requires Azure AD Connect deployment and device migration)
- No internet connectivity for devices (Intune requires internet; SCCM retention required)
- Bare-metal imaging business-critical (no Intune equivalent; hybrid model required)
- Orchestration groups for business-critical server clusters (retain SCCM for servers)
- Extensive custom inventory dependencies (regulatory compliance, vendor audits)
- Legacy Office (2019/2021 perpetual) instead of Microsoft 365 Apps (Office Apps workload slider not applicable)

- 🔴 Significant Gap: 1 (OS Deployment)
- 🔴 Significant Gap to ⬛ No Equivalent: 1 (Infrastructure — Paradigm Shift)

### Key Themes

**Consistent Gaps Across Multiple Areas**:

1. **Pre-built content/baseline libraries** — SCCM has more pre-built baselines, reports, update catalogs; Intune requires recreation
2. **Single-object containers** — SCCM uses baselines, phased deployments, orchestration groups as single objects; Intune splits into multiple policies
3. **Server-specific capabilities** — Orchestration groups, maintenance windows, bare-metal imaging designed for server workloads; Intune workstation-centric
4. **Real-time ad-hoc query** — CMPivot instant multi-device queries; Intune alternatives are scheduled (Remediations) or non-real-time (Graph API, Log Analytics)

**Consistent Intune Advantages**:

1. **Cloud-native infrastructure** — Zero on-premises servers, automatic updates, Microsoft-managed, 99.9% SLA
2. **Conditional Access integration** — Zero-trust enforcement (SCCM compliance is report-only)
3. **Auto-generated settings/catalogs** — winget (10,000+ apps), Settings Catalog (5,000+ settings), security baseline auto-updates
4. **Modern APIs** — Graph API REST API superiority over SCCM WMI/SMS Provider
5. **User experience focus** — Endpoint Analytics, branded OOBE, self-service remediation via Company Portal

**Migration Success Factors**:

1. **Scenario-based assessment** — Not all-or-nothing migration; evaluate per-scenario (new device procurement vs. bare-metal imaging)
2. **Co-management for gradual transition** — Retain SCCM workloads for gaps during migration
3. **Cloud-first workloads migrate first** — New device procurement, workstation patching, user-focused apps, endpoint protection
4. **Hybrid long-term model acceptable** — Servers/complex scenarios in SCCM, workstations in Intune (co-management bridge indefinitely)
